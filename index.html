            <p>You&rsquo;re too kind! No, really, your presence at our celebration is what matters the most to us. We know that many of our guests are travelling from very far away to be with us, and we know that getting married on a Friday means that a lot of folks are missing work. We want to spend time with you and we want you to enjoy yourself!</p>

            <p>That said, we are #blessed in having the kindest friends and family in the world, and if your heart is too big to be constrained by our protests, you may peruse our registries below.</p>
